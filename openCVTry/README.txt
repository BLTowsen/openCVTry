OpenCV FaceTracker - Udacity C++ Developer Nanodegree final project

By Lawrance Towsen

Building and running project:
	- Run on windows operating system
	  (Is possible on Linux but I couldn't get it working on virtual 
	  machine as there wasn't enough storage for source code of opencv)
	
	- Installing and setting up openCV follow this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-VHaLHC4XI
	
	- Run on x64 setting in visual studio debug mode

	- When running the program:
			- For webcam input 'w' into the console
			- Else make sure the video you are analysing is in the same file as the source code and input video name with extension

	- To close the program press any key twice


	Project Description:
	This is a project that allows the user to input a video or use their webcam 
	and then the program tracks the face/s in the video.
	It does this by creating a new VideoAnalysis class object that allows the user to call a method to analyze the video input.
	

Rubric Points Addressed:
	- C++ functions and control systems are used
	- Project reads data from a file 
	- Project accepts user input 
	- OOP techniques are used
	- Appropriate access specifiers are used
	- Class consructors utilize member utilization lists
	- Classes abstract implementation details from their interfaces
